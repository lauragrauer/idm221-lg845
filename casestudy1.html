    <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
    <p>This project focused on exploring the principles, patterns, and methods of interaction design. In my search for an app that could benefit from a fresh approach, I selected the widely used task management tool, Todoist. Known for effectively organizing tasks, setting deadlines, and structuring projects into manageable sections, Todoist was an ideal candidate for enhancement.
    <br><br>In this rebranding, I aimed to improve Todoist’s usability and user engagement by emphasizing simplicity and feedback. After analyzing the app’s current navigation patterns, input controls, and onboarding flows, I identified several elements with room for improvement. As a result, I implemented a rebranding of the micro-interactions and overall interface to reduce cognitive load and create a more seamless, user-friendly experience.</p>

        <h3>TODOIST</h3>
        <h4>GENERAL USERS & USABILITY ANALYSIS</h4>
        <p>While Todoist is a highly popular task management app, it’s primarily designed with detail-oriented users in mind, such as those in corporate or academic settings. Its interface includes a wide range of advanced features, but this can sometimes feel overbearing for some users.</p></div>

<!-- TASK AND APPFLOW SECTION -->

                <br>
                <h4>TASK & APPFLOW</h4>
                <p>The original app’s task flow is functional, but there is potential for a more streamlined approach to text usage and button layout that simplifies the process of creating and removing tasks.

                    The number of buttons and options may lead to cognitive overload for users seeking a quick and straightforward experience. While triggers and interactions within this certain task are cohesive, some premium features require in-app purchases to unlock without prior indication.
                    
                    This could create uncertainty for users who may expect complete functionality upon installation. Providing clearer access to premium features or indicating in-app purchases would enhance the transparency of the app’s functionality and pricing structure.
                <br><hr><p> The same can go for the app flow as well. There are a large number of triggers needed to provide the following feedback, and they fall into the numerous menus displayed in the home location.

                Users will have to spend time learning and familiarizing themselves with the location of each function.</p>

    <h3>RECONSTRUCTION</h3>
    <h4>WIREFRAMES & WIREFLOW</h4>
    <p>The initial creation of wireframes was needed to establish a clear foundation for the rebrand.

    <br><br>To make the app more accessible to a broader user base not accustomed to cognitively demanding interfaces, a simplified layout and format were essential. This restructuring aimed to minimize mental load, allowing users of varying backgrounds to navigate tasks quickly.</p></div>
    <hr>
    <div class="custom-content-box">
        <p>To do so, I've created buttons with larger padding to enhance touch accuracy and ensure easy usability across different devices.This also contributes to a clean, uncluttered design that highlights key actions without an overwhelming feeling. A change of task bar locations, as well as a simplification, was also implemented to reduce the cognitive load a user may experience.As for the wire flow displayed, a simplification of feedback was constructed to offer a more efficient action and feedback method.
        <br><br>Symbols were also implemented to give the user a better understanding of their action, as well as an undo button for incorrect action taken by the user.</p></div>
