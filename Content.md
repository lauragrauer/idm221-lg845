# **CASE STUDY 1**
## TODO List App Interaction Design
### <b>Project Summary</b>
> ToDoist is a task management tool and is helpful for organizing tasks, setting deadlines, and categorizing sections. Such can be a great tool for personal goals, work, and education.
### <b>General Users</b>
> Although this is one of the most popular task management apps in digital devices, it is mostly oriented  towards those in a more detail oriented spectrum, such as individuals working in a corporate company. Nonetheless, the average person is still able to access this.
### <b>Negatives and Positives</b>
> The original ToDoist app is a well known app prioritizing a task list for anyone with a digital device. Despite this, it is also known to be difficult to learn, and primarily caters to detail oriented individuals. I’ve noticed there are countless amounts of small buttons full of detail, leading to a potential increase of information overload.
### <b>Design Process</b>
> With a recreation of this app, I believed some areas held their value. An example would be the well saturated colors the previous program used in contrast to the monochrome background. To further accentuate divisions, I felt it was best to add more colors than previously, as well as simplification of text to make it more convenient to the average individual.
### <b>Task and App Flow</b>
> Again, the previous app and task flow works, yet it could have a more simplified use of text. The amount of buttons could be simplified as well to decrease the amount of overload. Adding on to this, all of the triggers work in a coherent manner, however certain areas of the app also require you to have in-app purchases without notice, which may confuse the average user.
### <b>Wire Flow</b>
> Previous to any color palette changes, a creation of wireframes and wireflows are needed. A change of the structure/ formatting was needed for a simplification towards a larger range of user diversity, such as young students who are typically not associated with heavily cognitive matters.
### <b>IX Flow</b>
> Next would be the valuable IX Flow. Showing this alongside the changed color palette exemplified my interpretation of a simplified and organized task management tool catering to a larger audience. Every task is sectioned off to their own locations in both subject to date. To make it more engaging, more microinteractions were also included to both enhance the flow and make it less stagnant and stiff.
### <b>Final Animation</b>
> This is the final animation of the redesigned app. It harbors a more simplified to-do list with the removement of unnecessary areas of the app, a more contrasting color palette, and enhanced microinteractions.

# **CASE STUDY 2**
## Street Tails Rescue Website Redesign</b>
### <b>Project Summary</b>
> Street Tails Animal Rescue is located in the upscale Philadelphia area and stands apart from other dog adoption services through the rescuing from local shelters. Unlike organizations providing essential services, their primary mission is to provide emotional companionship through their customers' willingness to obtain a furry companion. Given the city-like demographic in Philadelphia, there is a lower demand for service dogs, which is a need Street Tail’s does not focus on.  Instead, their efforts are dedicated to nurturing the bond between humans and their new family members, enriching lives through the joy of pet ownership.
### <b>Negatives and Positives</b>
> The Street Tail’s website has an ample color palette to maintain a somewhat clean, yet homely atmosphere. However, the main issue with this would be their lack of words. The information provided is located in another website and focuses on their basic demographics. They provide no back story for these animals and only give a general description, so they lack vital emotional contribution. Furthermore, the home page itself is merely a repeated task bar.
### <b>Design Goals</b>
> The goal for this redesign would be to implement a cleaner, understandable look, provide enough valuable yet simplified information of adoptions, yet still maintain a homely atmosphere of the website. These are the rough drafts created prior to the final result. I had tried to keep the brown atmosphere from the original website with a hint of color for imperative information. Though I feel it increased the emotional value, I feel as if more should have been changed to provide easier access to the essentials.
### <b>General Users</b>
> Their general users primarily pertain to potential adopters looking to adopt a pet from a unique shelter. It may also have donors, possible volunteers for their dog walking program, other pet owners or foster care providers as well.
### <b>Wireframing</b>
> The users may be usings different platforms, so it is best to propose the most used ones: the general desktop, tablet, and iPad. These devices visually differ from one another in terms of their dimensions, so their contrasting use of spacing is something to be taken note of.
### <b>Atomic Design w/ Color Palette, Font, Theme Choices</b> 
> ### <b>Color Palette</b> 
>> I believe the previous color palette was very homely and held well for its emotional value. However, many areas of the website felt as if it blended too much with other sections, so it is best for a higher contrast of values and colors that still prioritize the homely nature is a must.
> ### <b>Typography</b> 
>> Sometimes, certain pages would alter their fonts in the original home page. It is important to maintain consistency for the users, so I believe a non changing use of a simplistic font was the best option.
> ### <b>Theme Choices</b>
>> To maintain the emotional appeal of the “product,” I believe having simplistic graphics implemented into the website would further increase it and appeal to the general users. As a result, I constructed the matter.
### <b>Microinteraction Input</b>
> An emotionally driven appearance of the website must have both organic and modern animations displayed through the microinteractions. As a result, I have blended the two together so users would still be aware they are using technology but doing so due to its emotional appeal.
### <b>Final Results & Heuristic Evaluation</b>
> Instead of creating a primarily brown to tan based background for this website, participants of the heuristic evaluation agreed a white background proved to provide a quicker interpretation of information valuable for the viewer. This change allowed for the inclusion of animations, illustrations, and valuable information while maintaining the homely atmosphere. The charts also shows how the final design successfully combines visual appeal with emotional engagement, providing an effective platform for pet adoptions. When having colleagues evaluate my version of the website in contrast to the original, the majority agreed with the statements listed above.

# **CASE STUDY 3**
## Yale School of Art Wireframing Redesign
### <b>Project Summary</b>
> This case study focuses on the wireframing redesign of the Yale School of Art’s website with the primary goal focusing on the enhancement of user experience through a more intuitive yet visually appealing interface. The redesign aims to prioritize accessibility, correcting feedback input and enhancing constraints to create a stronger connection between institution and community. 
### <b>General Users</b>
> The website is accessible to the public eye, however there is also a unique feature not many other websites pertain to. The Yale School of Art website can be edited by any student who currently goes to the school, whether it be the images in the background or text displayed in the primary sections.
### <b>Background Information & Layout</b>
> The Yale School of Art website is infamous for its unique student editing feature and its association with its overly complex/ confusing navigation. Many visitors report the difficulty in finding key resources, further separating the schools association with the website and its student community. 
### <b>Change 1. Site Navigation Bar</b>
> The main issue of the original wireframe is the location of the taskbar. Because of its uncommon placement towards the left, there is decreased accessibility for the majority of users. A higher learning curve is created as a result and a potential cognitive load, resulting in a user’s reduced efficiency navigating the website. 
By placing the navigation bar into a more common area of a website, this resolution improves discoverability by making it easier for users to locate available menu options. Not only that, but there is also a removement of unnecessary clutter as well as a color palette separation for increased user visibility.

### <b>Change 2. Button Feedback</b>
> With the second change comes the button feedback, or lack thereof. Because there is no feedback for the buttons, the user is unable to distinguish buttons from the page’s general information; there is also no clear interpretation of actions as a result.
A resolution would be to implement distinguishable feedback towards the buttons so the user will become aware of not only the button’s location through hovering and design changes, but also recognizable through color and animation changes.

### <b>Change 3. Increased Constraints</b>
> There is little to no use of constraints for the college’s website. Only Yale School of Art students can edit the pages, however the ability to edit a page is divided into sections rather than the entirety of the page which increases the inconsistency and affordance. This results in an increase of possible visibility inadequacy depending on the change a student may make and lack of quality control.
To change this, a more visible rule and implementation of constraints is needed for the entirety of the page through an application. Not only can art students still offer their creativity, but the entirety of the page with further approval must be edited to ensure current visible consistency and reduced risk of misinformation.

### <b>Change 4. Altered Mapping</b>
> All in all, the original mapping is poorly unnatural and inconsistent. There is an unclear control placement with cognitive load with a lack of website value towards the user.
The final resolution would be to increase the natural mapping in correlation to other similar websites. This reduces the need for finding information through the user’s memory and reduces cognitive load. The unique trait of students having the ability to edit the site will still be of use, however consistent mapping will increase a clear information hierarchy.

### <b>Conclusion</b>
> Overall, this website is incredibly unique. However natural changes of the mapping and taskbar, creation of button feedback, and increasing of constraints were needed for the importance of prioritizing user needs and usability principles in web design.
